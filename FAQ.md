# Frequently Asked Questions

### How is this course different from COGS 120? 

COGS 120 is designed to introduce you to more theory and on-going research. If you are interested in that, COGS 120 is a great choice! This course is intended to introduce you to hands-on, practical aspects of interaction design.   

### Will you approve my enrollment without the prerequisites?

Yes, I will approve *any* petition for exceptions of prerequisites. 

### Are there requirements for synchronous participation?

Yes, this course will be offered in person and synchronous participation is expected. In particular, while you may skip lectures, you **must** attend your studio each week.   

### I would like to enroll after the start of the quarter (or I have enrolled late). Can I make up late assignments? 

You have access to all materials prior to enrollment (e.g., all readings & assignments are posted on the course website **not** on Canvas). You are expected to submit any assignments on time, and will have access to the same late submission policy as all other students.   

This follows official department policy:   
*Students who add CSE courses during the first two weeks will not be allowed to make-up missed assignments. If you are on the waitlist for a course, you are expected to attend class for the first two weeks and complete assignments. If students choose not to attend class or to not turn in assignments on due dates, the student will receive a "0" on all missed assignments/quizzes/etc. No exceptions are made.*
