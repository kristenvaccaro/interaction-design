# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why do I need to submit a course clearance request through EASy?

According to the department:
> The enrollment system is not set up to allow us to have varying prerequisites for our CSE 190 sections. It views CSE 190 as the same course. So all CSE 190's require department approval and we manually have to look for prerequisites. Since Human-AI Interaction has no prerequisites, we would just issue the clearance. But for other CSE 190's, we manually verify the students have completed them before issuing the clearance needed.

### If my EASy application is approved, am I guaranteed a spot in the class?

No. Again, according to the department:
> An EASy approval does NOT guarantee a spot in the course.

The caps for courses are handled in the registration system (not EASy). Seats are available on a first come first serve basis, as space permits. Once seats are filled, you can waitlist the course after your 2nd pass enrollment window opens.

### Will this course be offered again?

Yes, this course is likely to be offered every year.

### Are there requirements for synchronous participation?

Yes, this course will be offered in person and synchronous participation is expected.
