## Quizzes

The quizzes will ask similar questions and prepare you for the final exam. The quizzes will in be in-class. 


## Final Exam

A final exam will evaluate your understanding of the material for the entire quarter. It will consist of multiple choice and open-ended responses, similar to the quizzes and in-class discussions and activities. The final exam time is set by the university, and can be found on Blink. I am happy to offer a conflict exam. If everyone who is interested can attend the conflict exam time, no reason/excuse is needed. Otherwise, students with more serious conflicts will be prioritized. Look out for a survey near the end of the quarter.
