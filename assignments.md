# Assignments

There will be five forms of assessment over the quarter: active participation in design studios (20%), weekly design assignments (25%), coding assignments (20%), quizzes (10%), and a final exam (25%). All deadlines are given in PT.  

## Studio Attendance  & Active Participation   
You will present your weekly design assignment in your studio each week (1-2 minutes) and receive feedback from your peers. The steps of the critique will be:    
1) **Listen:** Students will present their own work briefly (1-2 minutes). Other students should listen attentively: no phones, no working on your own project.    
2) **Ask questions:** Students should ask any questions they have about the work or the process. Examples: what inspired you? How did you accomplish X? What is your goal with element Y? Etc.   
3) **Offer feedback/suggestions:** Should have a reason/rationale. No personal attacks. If you provide negative feedback, you must provide a constructive suggestion. I like it because… You could improve by…   

   
As a general rule, you should expect to contribute at least 3 times to the discussion each studio. If active participation becomes an issue, we will count number of times each student participates. 

Each missed studio attendance will lose 25% of your total studio attendance grade. To request an excused absence, fill out [this Google form](https://forms.gle/M77m6T62NeBCsPLcA) by 4:30PM the day before your studio; if your absence is excused, your TA will confirm that before the start of class. 

## Design Assignments

You will complete ten weekly design assignments over the course of the quarter. These design assignments will help you understand and apply the concepts we talk about in class.  

Design assignments will be due at 11:59PM Friday, every week.

#### Assignment #1
Due Week 1 Friday (October 4), 11:59PM  

You will develop a plan for conducting a needfinding study. Note, next week you will conduct the needfinding, so keep that in mind!   
You may not use students as your needer group! Instead, I recommend identifying a topic or area of interest to you. Here are some ideas from past years:

Surfers at the beach   
Senior citizens shopping at UTC mall   
People working at a local community garden   
Gaming-focused livestreamers on Twitch   
Knitters on a knitting-related social media forum    
Baristas working at a local coffee shop    
Late night workers at fast food places (e.g., McDonalds)    
Vendors at a farmers market   
Children visiting a museum in Balboa Park

Week 10 please come for help with any issues in the coding on your final project. 

## Quizzes
  
The quizzes will ask similar questions and prepare you for the final exam. Quizzes will be released on [PrairieLearn](https://us.prairielearn.com/pl/course_instance/165782) each Monday, and will be due by Friday 5PM.    

## Final Exam

A final exam will evaluate your understanding of the material for the entire quarter. It will consist of multiple choice and open-ended responses, similar to the quizzes and in-class discussions and activities. The final exam time is set by the university, and can be found on Blink. I am happy to offer a conflict exam. If everyone who is interested can attend the conflict exam time, no reason/excuse is needed. Otherwise, students with more serious conflicts will be prioritized. Look out for a survey near the end of the quarter.
